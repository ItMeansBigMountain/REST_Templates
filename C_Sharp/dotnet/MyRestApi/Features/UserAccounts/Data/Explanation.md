# Data Directory

This directory contains the repository interface and implementation for managing user data in the application.

## Files

### `IUserRepository.cs`

- **Description**: 
  This file defines the `IUserRepository` interface, which outlines the methods for interacting with user data. It includes methods for fetching all users, fetching a user by ID, adding a new user, updating an existing user, and deleting a user.

### `UserRepository.cs`

- **Description**: 
  This file contains the implementation of the `IUserRepository` interface. The `UserRepository` class uses Entity Framework Core to perform CRUD operations on the user data in the database. It includes methods for getting all users, getting a user by ID, adding a new user, updating an existing user, and deleting a user.

### Why Use Interfaces? (Non-Technical Explanation)

Think of interfaces in programming like a set of rules or guidelines that different pieces of your project agree to follow. Here’s why they are important and how they help:

1. **Clear Expectations**:
   - **Example**: Imagine a recipe book. The recipe (interface) tells you what ingredients and steps are needed without telling you exactly how each step should be done.
   - **Benefit**: Everyone knows exactly what to do without needing to know the details of how others do their part.

2. **Easy Changes**:
   - **Example**: If a restaurant changes its chef (implementation), the new chef can still follow the same recipe (interface) without changing the menu.
   - **Benefit**: You can make changes behind the scenes without disrupting the whole system.

3. **Flexibility**:
   - **Example**: You can replace an old tool with a new one as long as it fits the same power outlet (interface).
   - **Benefit**: This allows you to swap parts of the system easily.

4. **Testing**:
   - **Example**: When testing a new dish, you can use a taste tester (mock interface) instead of a real customer to make sure it’s good before serving it.
   - **Benefit**: This helps in testing parts of the system without needing the whole setup.

5. **Consistency**:
   - **Example**: In a sports team, every player knows the rules of the game (interface) and plays their part, whether they are new or experienced.
   - **Benefit**: Ensures everyone knows what to expect and can work together smoothly.

### Summary
Using interfaces is like having a set of universal rules or guidelines that different parts of a system agree to follow. This makes the system easier to understand, more flexible, easier to change and test, and ensures everything works well together, just like a Universal TV remote that can control different brands of TVs.
